                     to technology. For example, I made sure to include big
                      icons with descriptive words to create less confusion, 
                      high contrast for the colors to make it easier to view,
                       and to make it readable by keeping the font style to
                        sans serif.</p>

        <p class="conlusion-para">With this project, I was able to learn and gain valuable insight 
            in regards to user behaviours, app usability, design patterns, 
            and more. Specifically focusing on senior citizens made me learn
             more about the issues that many individuals face regarding 
             accessibility and navigation that one might not think about 
             otherwise. When designing apps, it is very important to focus
             on the target user while still keeping it accessible to
              everyone. Overall, I hope to further develop TripPal by 
              creating a High-Fidelity mockup and to keep on looking to
               improve the user experience.</p>
