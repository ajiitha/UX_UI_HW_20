        <h2 class="prob-statement">Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>Research and user interviews uncovered that many international students struggle to navigate the unfamiliar culture, find social connections, and access resources for various needs.

Therefore, providing a centralized platform that offers both mentorship and peer support programs, as well as a directory of resources for job search, housing, legal aid, and mental health support, could greatly benefit international students in their transition and help them succeed in their academic and personal life.

            <p>This mobile app designed for international students in Canada offers a comprehensive and inclusive solution to many of the common challenges faced by individuals from different countries studying in a new environment. 

It provides a variety of resources such as a helpline for social support, housing options, job postings, events, and campus activities to ensure that students have access to the information they need to make the most of their time in Canada. In addition, the app also provides mental health resources, access to community and other international students, and a translator to help with language barriers. 

This app is a valuable tool for students seeking to integrate into Canadian society and make the most of their study abroad experience.</strong></p>

One of the main Iterations that we made based on our test was making the sign up option more accessible and visible since in our user flow we want users to sign up using their emails. Also in the ‘find a connection screen’ we changed community connection to go first because our app is based on helping people find others like them and changed the word mentos to advisors to make things more simple.Here you can see we added the IOS updates, like the keyboard, icons and navigation bars. So here we have the splash, Location permission screen, resources we offer screen and texting a helpline worker screen."</p>
